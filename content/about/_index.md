Hi, I'm **Akhbari**, a student from Iraq, currently living in Germany.  

This blog is for documenting my **programming 🎒 journey**, projects, and experiments. I also love learning web technologies, but I often forget th9
e reason why I started writing.  

If you have any questions or suggestions, just send me a message:

- GitHub: [github.com/sahihx](https://github.com/sahihx)  

You can also report **broken links or other issues** if you find any.  

May you enjoy!
