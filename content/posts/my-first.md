بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم 
Welcome to my first post on **Akhbari**’s blog!  
Here I’ll share my personal notes, thoughts, and progress on Rust projects and web experiments.

## Getting Started
I’ve been exploring Rust lately, building small tools and learning how to use it efficiently.

## Future Plans
- Write about building small Rust utilities  
- Share open-source experiments  
- Document interesting findings  

Stay tuned 🚀
